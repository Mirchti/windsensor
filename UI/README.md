NodeJS Windsensor
========
NodeJs webserver to display histograms, statistics and realtime wind data.

required nodejs modules:
--------------
* express
* recon
* socket.io

 run "npm install" to install all modules.
 run "npm start" to launch the application.

nodejs configuration:
-------------
file config.json:
 {
  "windserver": {
    "port": 2400,
    "hostname": "127.0.0.1"
  },
  "httpserver": {
    "port": 4800
  },
  "datafilename": "data.json"
 }

this will configure the HTTP server to listen on port 4800, and tell the TCP client to connect to host 127.0.0.1 on port 2400.
This programm assumes the windsensorserver.py script running on localhost port 2400 transmitting the current wind speed.
It uses the file 'data.json' as database. The database is written on exit and every 5 minutes to conserve the raspberries flash. 
All graphs are generated by rickshaw. The data is transmitted in realtime using websockets.

run:
----------------
'node server.js' or 'npm start'
